	     <h3>How does this work?</h3>
	     <p>
	      We send an official email to your professors asking them if there has been a change in the book since the last semester or since they last taught it. If there has been,
              we notify everyone involved: those taking the class (those who have the books and those who do not), as well as those who have taken the class and have a copy of the book.
              
              If you have a copy of the old book (students going to take the class, and students who have already taken it), we offer you an easy way to give back to the community!
                We put you in touch with someone who might need it.
	     </p>
	     <p>
	      This way, you easily stay on top of your books! 
	     </p>
             
             <p>Another feature we are thinking of implementing is allowing TA's of classes to identify themselves to give current students an insight
             into the course, as well as books (books not used by the class) that helped them gain a deeper understanding of the area.</p>
